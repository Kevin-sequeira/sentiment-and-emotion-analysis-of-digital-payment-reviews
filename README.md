India's financial ecosystem relies on digital payment channels for ease and efficiency. This study examines Indian digital payment evaluation sentiment and emotions. PhonePe, Paytm, Google Pay, and Cred provided reviews. Data cleansing, lemmatization, and tokenization improved the text data for sentiment analysis. TextBlob categorized the reviews as good, negative, or neutral. The Vader tool classified reviews' emotions, including sadness, joy, anger, surprise, disappointment, and exhilaration. The study uses natural language processing and preprocessing to understand users' feelings about digital payment services. Four machine learning algorithms—SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier—were deployed to improve sentiment analysis. Each sentiment classification method was trained and tested on a labeled dataset. The study uses machine learning methods and preprocessing to better interpret user sentiment in digital payment reviews. This comprehensive approach evaluates each payment app's strengths and drawbacks and suggests improvements.SVM, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier were used to classify review emotions. To optimize emotional analysis, reviews were preprocessed. The study tested emotional analysis accuracy using these classifiers and preprocessing methods to better understand user emotions towards different digital payment apps. Word clouds depicted the reviews' feelings and sentiments. Users' feelings and sentiments were graphed to give a clear picture of India's digital payment review emotional landscape. This multi-dimensional methodology and preprocessing help us evaluate user experiences and identify digital payment service optimization opportunities.
